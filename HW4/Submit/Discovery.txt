Being able to compare two dna sequences and get their distance in as little as 15 min on a normal desktop is incredible.
It really has amazing applications in the scientific field. This allows us to really dive indepth into
DNA and figure out how we compare to other species. This allows us to do more accurate testing and see how 
we can improve the human life.
